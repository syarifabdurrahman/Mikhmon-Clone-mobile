## 🆕 Previous Updates (March 10, 2026)

### 1. Navigation Hiccups Fix ✅
**Fixed interface traffic "connect/disconnect" flashes and graph hiccups when navigating**

- **Issue**: When navigating between Dashboard → Hotspot Host → Dashboard, the interface showed "connect/disconnect" flashes and the graph hiccuped
- **Root Causes**:
  1. No `ref.keepAlive()` on providers caused disposal/recreation on navigation
  2. Dashboard periodic timer fired immediately on widget creation
  3. Traffic monitor timer also fired immediately
  4. Stale cache check triggered immediate fetch on navigation
- **Fixes**:
  1. Added `ref.keepAlive()` to `InterfaceTrafficNotifier` and `SystemResourcesNotifier` to prevent disposal
  2. Removed `_refreshInBackground()` method (no longer needed)
  3. Removed stale cache check from dashboard - use cached data instantly
  4. Delayed both dashboard and traffic monitor timers by 3 seconds using `Future.delayed`
- **Impact**: Seamless navigation without hiccups or connect/disconnect flashes
- **Files**:
  - `lib/providers/app_providers.dart`
  - `lib/screens/dashboard/dashboard_screen.dart`
  - `lib/screens/dashboard/widgets/traffic_monitor_widgets.dart`

### 2. Platform "Unknown" Issue Fix ✅
**Fixed platform intermittently becoming "unknown" on dashboard**

- **Issue**: Sometimes the platform value became "unknown" on dashboard, which triggered hiccups again
- **Root Causes**:
  1. No protection against concurrent fetches causing race conditions
  2. Empty/incomplete API responses not validated
  3. No string validation in SystemResources.fromJson
- **Fixes**:
  1. Added `_isFetching` flag to prevent concurrent fetches
  2. Added better data validation (check for specific fields like 'platform', 'cpu-load', 'free-memory')
  3. Added `_safeString()` helper to handle null/empty strings
  4. Added comprehensive debug logging
- **Impact**: Platform no longer becomes "unknown", race conditions eliminated
- **Files**:
  - `lib/screens/dashboard/dashboard_screen.dart`
  - `lib/services/models.dart`

### 3. Graph Time Labels Fix ✅
**Fixed time labels resetting to "0s" on reload and added proper elapsed time display**

- **Issue**: Time labels showed "0s" again when data reloaded, not accurate elapsed time
- **Root Cause**: X-coordinates were relative (0, 1, 2, ...) calculated from current window, not actual timestamps
- **Fixes**:
  1. Changed x-coordinates to use actual elapsed time in seconds from reference timestamp
  2. Added `_formatElapsedTime()` for proper time formatting (30s, 2m, 3m30s, 1h15m, etc.)
  3. Removed 60.0 clamp on `maxX` to allow continuous scrolling beyond 3 minutes
  4. Updated chart labels to use x-coordinate (elapsed seconds) directly
- **Impact**: Time labels now show accurate elapsed time that doesn't reset on reload
- **Files**:
  - `lib/screens/dashboard/widgets/combined_resource_chart.dart`

### 4. Initial Load Indicator ✅
**Added lazy loading indicator for first-time dashboard data fetch**

- **Issue**: No visual feedback when fetching data for the first time
- **Fixes**:
  1. Added `_isInitialLoad` flag to track first data load
  2. Set `_isInitialLoad = false` after successful data load from all sources
  3. Updated `_buildBody()` to show "Loading dashboard..." with CircularProgressIndicator when `_isInitialLoad && _isLoading`
  4. Improved chart empty state with loading indicator and "Waiting for first data point" message
- **Impact**: Users see clear loading indicator on first load, seamless updates afterwards
- **Files**:
  - `lib/screens/dashboard/dashboard_screen.dart`
  - `lib/screens/dashboard/widgets/combined_resource_chart.dart`

### 5. Auto-Refresh Timer Fix ✅
**Fixed traffic monitoring auto-refresh to work in real-time mode**

- **Issue**: Traffic rates not updating automatically every 3 seconds in real-time mode (not demo mode)
- **Root Cause**: `_loadInitialData()` called from `initState()` ran before provider data was loaded, so timer never started
- **Fix**:
  - Added `_timerStarted` flag to prevent duplicate timers
  - Moved `_startAutoRefresh()` call to `build()` method which uses `ref.watch()` and triggers when data arrives
  - Timer now starts correctly regardless of data loading timing
- **Impact**: Traffic rates now auto-update every 3 seconds in both demo and real-time modes
- **Files**: `lib/screens/dashboard/widgets/traffic_monitor_widgets.dart`

### 6. Network Permissions Added ✅
**Fixed "Permission denied" error when connecting to RouterOS**

- **Issue**: App couldn't connect to RouterOS in real-time mode, showing "SocketException: Connection failed (OS Error: Permission denied)"
- **Root Cause**: AndroidManifest.xml was missing INTERNET permission required for network sockets
- **Fix**: Added network permissions before `<application>` tag:
  ```xml
  <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />
  <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE" />
  ```
- **Impact**: App can now successfully connect to RouterOS devices on port 8728
- **File**: `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`

### 7. Removed Refresh Button ✅
**Cleaned up UI to match system resources card**

- **Issue**: Traffic monitor had manual refresh button with "Updating..." state, inconsistent with system resources
- **Solution**:
  - Removed `_buildRefreshIndicator()` method entirely
  - Removed `_isRefreshing` state variable
  - Simplified `_silentRefresh()` by removing try/finally blocks
  - Changed header to use `Expanded` widget for text (no spacer/refresh button)
- **Result**: Clean, silent auto-refresh like system resources card - no visible refresh indicators
- **File**: `lib/screens/dashboard/widgets/traffic_monitor_widgets.dart`

### 8. Real-Time Traffic Rate Updates ✅
**Fixed traffic monitoring to show live per-second rates**

- **Issue**: Traffic rates showing "0 B/s" instead of real-time values
- **Root Cause**: Demo mode wasn't calling `_trafficRateService.calculateRates()` in `build()`, `refresh()`, and `silentRefresh()`
- **Fix**: Added rate calculation for demo mode in all three methods
- **Impact**: TX and RX rates now update correctly every 3 seconds
- **Files**: `lib/providers/app_providers.dart`

### 9. Smooth Traffic Text Updates ✅
**Refactored to use ValueNotifier for text-only updates**

- **Issue**: Entire card was rebuilding causing visual flicker
- **Solution**: Used `ValueNotifier` for each traffic value (TX total, RX total, TX rate, RX rate)
- **Implementation**: `ValueListenableBuilder` wraps each text widget for independent updates
- **Result**: Text values update smoothly without rebuilding card structure
- **File**: `lib/screens/dashboard/widgets/traffic_monitor_widgets.dart`

### 10. About Dialog with Developers ✅
**Added developer information to Settings > About**

- **Developers**: Favian Hugo and Syarif Abdurrahman
- **UI**: Two developer cards with icons and names
- **Style**: Matching app theme with purple primary color
- **File**: `lib/screens/settings/settings_screen.dart`

### 11. Responsive Developer Cards ✅
**Fixed overflow issue on smaller screens**

- **Issue**: "Syarif Abdurrahman" text overflowed on small screens
- **Solution**:
  - Used `Expanded` widgets for flexible width
  - Reduced horizontal padding from 16 to 8
  - Added `FittedBox` to prevent text overflow
- **Result**: Cards adapt to all screen sizes without overflow
- **File**: `lib/screens/settings/settings_screen.dart`

### 12. Hotspot Hosts Monitoring ✅
**DHCP lease/binding monitoring with real-time updates**

- **Feature**: Complete hotspot hosts monitoring showing all connected devices
- **Data Model**: `HotspotHost` class with MAC address, IP address, authorization status, bypassed status, user association, uptime, and idle time
- **API Integration**: RouterOS `/ip/hotspot/host/print` command to fetch DHCP hosts
- **State Management**: `HotspotHostsNotifier` with AsyncNotifier, auto-refreshes every 5 seconds
- **UI Features**:
  - Search by IP, MAC address, or username
  - Filter chips (All, Authorized, Unauthorized, Bypassed)
  - Color-coded status badges (Emerald for authorized, Amber for bypassed, Slate for unauthorized)
  - Card-based layout with connection details
  - Demo mode support with 4 sample hosts
- **Navigation**: Added route and dashboard button for easy access

│ RouterOS API Protocol (port 8728)                       │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ • Encoding: Variable-length (1-5 bytes)                 │
│ • Login: Post-v6.43 plain text in one sentence           │
│   /login                                                  │
│   =name=username                                          │
│   =password=password                                     │
│   '' (empty word terminator)                               │
│ • Termination: Zero-length word for each sentence        │
│ • Responses: !re (data), !done (end), !trap (error)       │
│ • Multi-record: Each !re starts new record              │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
